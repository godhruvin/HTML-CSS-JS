## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my practice and projects that demonstrate my understanding of core programming concepts and web development techniques. Each folder contains a specific topic or project, and most have a README file with further details.

## Concepts and Topics

Here are some of the key JavaScript concepts and topics I have practiced:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding `let`, `const`, `var`, and various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects).
- **Control Structures**: Implementation of conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`).
- **Functions**: Writing and using function expressions, arrow functions, and higher-order functions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and update the DOM.
- **ES6 Features**: Exploring new features such as template literals, destructuring, and spread/rest operators.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Understanding promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating and using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in JavaScript.

## Problems Solved

Throughout my learning process, I have solved various coding challenges and problems, including:

- Implementing algorithms such as sorting and searching.
- Solving common problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
- Creating small applications like to-do lists and calculators.
- Building interactive web features using vanilla JavaScript.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. **To-Do List Application / Task Management System**
   - A simple web app to add, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

2. **Calculator**
   - A basic calculator with functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

3. **Quiz App**
   - An interactive quiz application with multiple-choice questions.
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
